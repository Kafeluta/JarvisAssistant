Why The Portfolio Exists\n\nYour portfolio shows how you grew during the Applied GenAI\nsemester. Your grade leans heavily on your process\u2014the\nreflections, iterations, and documented learning steps\u2014so spotlight\nthose first, then back them up with your strongest work samples and\nmap everything to the official learning outcomes.\n2. Choose Your Adventure\nOrganise either by:\nLearning Tracks:\n1. Industry Project\n2. Professional Research Project\n3. Knowledge Sharing Impact Lab\nLearning Outcomes\nView detailed outcomes \u2192\nPick one scheme and stick to it for sanity's sake. Learning tracks\nis probably the best choice.\n3. Core Ingredients (Must-Haves)\n\nEvery portfolio needs these five essential components. Think of them\nas your foundation\u2014without these, even the best work won't shine\nproperly:\n\ud83d\udcdd Intro\nContains: Who you are, why you picked AI Basics, and a quick\n\"how to read me.\"\nWhy it matters: Sets the stage for everything that follows.\n\ud83c\udfaf Evidence\nContains: Your strong"}, {"path": "./Docs\\MA-AAI-MC ePub - Canvas by Instructure.pdf", "text": "on't shine\nproperly:\n\ud83d\udcdd Intro\nContains: Who you are, why you picked AI Basics, and a quick\n\"how to read me.\"\nWhy it matters: Sets the stage for everything that follows.\n\ud83c\udfaf Evidence\nContains: Your strongest artifacts from all tracks\u2014code, visuals,\nanalysis, ethics write-ups, etc.\nWhy it matters: Proves you can actually do what you claim.\n\ud83d\udcad Reflection\nContains: Commentary for each artifact: what you learned,\nhurdles, fixes, which outcome it nails, and how it connects with\nother work.\nWhy it matters: Shows insight and deep thinking beyond surface-\nlevel work.\n\ud83d\udcc8 Growth\nContains: Early vs. final versions (with mini-reflections).\nWhy it matters: Demonstrates measurable progress over time.\n\n\ud83d\uddfa\ufe0f Outcome Map\nContains: Quick table or tags linking artifacts to learning\noutcomes.\nWhy it matters: Makes grading a breeze for your assessors.\n4. How to Select Evidence\nThe art of curation is knowing what to include and what to leave out.\nHere's your selection strategy:\n\ud83c\udfaf Quality > Quantity\nThree killer pieces beat ten mediocre ones.

Think of this as your chance to be the narrator of\nyour own learning story:\nSo what? Impact & Significance\nWhy does this piece matter?

Design & Navigation Tips\nA well-designed portfolio is like a well-organized museum\u2014visitors\nshould never feel lost or overwhelmed. Here are your essential\ndesign principles:\n\ud83d\udcd1 Table of Contents: Start with a clear roadmap so readers know\nwhat to expect and can jump to sections that interest them most.\n\ud83d\udd24 Clear Headers: Use consistent heading levels and descriptive\ntitles that actually tell readers what they're about to discover.\n\ud83d\udccf White Space: Give your content room to breathe.

Final Hand-In Checklist\nBefore you hit submit, run through this final quality check.
